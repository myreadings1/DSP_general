baseband signal
------
- Baseband is a signal that has a very narrow and near-zero frequency range, i.e. a spectral magnitude that is nonzero only for frequencies in the vicinity of the origin (termed f = 0) and negligible elsewhere [2].

passband
------
- A passband is the range of frequencies or wavelengths that can pass through a filter [1]. 




bandpass
-----
- A band-pass filter (also bandpass filter, BPF) is a device that passes frequencies within a certain range and rejects (attenuates) frequencies outside that range [3].
